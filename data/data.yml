# A map of tasks per week of day
# A task has the following form:
# - subject:        (string. subject code) [REQUIRED]
#   name:           (string. if empty, generator is used)
#   time:           (string. when is this due? e.g. 2:15pm)
#   due_day:        (string. human readable e.g. 'Next Monday')
#   weeks:          (List[int]. The weeks in which the task should/shoudln't be added)
#   exclude_weeks:  (bool. given weeks are excluded if true)
#   priority:       (int. 1 is lowest, 4 is highest)
#   name_generator: (string. identifier of `name_list` used as  generator)
#   subtasks:       (list of tasks)
#
# The name of a task can be a template string, using the following
#   $week     | current week number
#   $nextweek | next week number
#   $date     | today's date in the format Mon 12 October
#
# Todoist also supports simple markdown formatting, such as *italics*, **bold** and [hyperlinks](example.com).
